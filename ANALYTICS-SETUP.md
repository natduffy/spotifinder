# Analytics Setup Guide for Spotifinder

This guide explains how to set up Google Analytics 4 (GA4) tracking for your Spotifinder music genre discovery app.

## What's Included

The analytics implementation includes:

- **Page View Tracking**: Tracks when users visit random mode vs search mode
- **User Interaction Tracking**: Monitors button clicks, genre selections, and page refreshes
- **Search Behavior Analytics**: Tracks search queries and search patterns
- **Custom Dimensions**: Page mode, user interaction type, and search behavior
- **Event Categorization**: Organized tracking for different types of user actions

## Setup Steps

### 1. Get Your Google Analytics 4 ID

1. Go to [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/)
2. Create a new property or use an existing one
3. Set up a web data stream for your domain
4. Copy your Measurement ID (format: G-XXXXXXXXXX)

### 2. Configure Analytics

1. Open `analytics-config.js`
2. Replace `G-XXXXXXXXXX` with your actual GA4 Measurement ID:
   ```javascript
   GA4_ID: 'G-XXXXXXXXXX', // Replace with your actual GA4 ID
   ```

### 3. Deploy

1. Upload all files to your web server
2. Ensure `analytics-config.js` is accessible
3. Test that analytics events are firing in your GA4 dashboard

## Tracked Events

### Page Views
- **Random Mode**: `page_view` with `page_mode: 'random'`
- **Search Mode**: `page_view` with `page_mode: 'search'`

### User Interactions
- **Refresh Genres**: `refresh_genres` event
- **Genre Clicks**: `genre_click` with genre name and mode
- **Show Random Genres**: `show_random_genres` from search mode

### Search Behavior
- **Search Queries**: `search_query` with query text and length
- **Search Results**: Tracks number of results found

## Custom Dimensions

The analytics setup uses GA4 custom parameters:

- `custom_parameter_1`: Page mode (random/search)
- `custom_parameter_2`: User interaction type
- `custom_parameter_3`: Search behavior patterns

## Testing Analytics

1. Open your website
2. Open browser DevTools â†’ Console
3. Perform actions (click buttons, search, etc.)
4. You should see analytics events logged
5. Check your GA4 Real-Time reports

## Privacy Considerations

- Analytics respect user privacy settings
- No personally identifiable information is collected
- Events are anonymized and aggregated
- Users can opt-out via browser settings

## Troubleshooting

### Analytics Not Working?
- Check that `analytics-config.js` is loaded before GA4 script
- Verify your GA4 ID is correct
- Ensure the file paths are correct
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors

### Events Not Showing in GA4?

- Verify your GA4 property settings
- Ensure your domain is properly configured
